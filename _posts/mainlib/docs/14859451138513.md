# p = problems we can solve reasonably fast
(in polynomial time)
eg: Sorting 
    Addition 
    subtraction
    multiplication
    division
    searching
    
# np = 
schedule


any problem that can be solved easily can also be checked easily
all P problem can always be NP
But can any problem that can be checked easily, like scheduling or prime factorization, also be solved easily, 
some can be verified easily

# NP-complete problem
can solve but can't check the solution


CS is just 60 years old,P could be equal to NP

## if we can easily check a problem's solution, can we also solve it easily?(P  = NP?)

## if we can't solve it fast, we can estimate an answer fast!

## if P = NP , we could solve any problem fast! Awesome.
